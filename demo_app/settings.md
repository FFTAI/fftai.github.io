# Accessing and Modifying Robot Settings

The RoCS Control App settings offer essential functionalities to tailor the robot's behavior and gather critical system information. Let's explore the key features available in the `Connection` and `System Info` tabs:

## Connection Tab

### Connection Status

The `Connection` tab provides insights into the connection status between the RoCS Control App and the robot. It displays the current status, indicating whether the app is connected or not. If the status is `Not connected`, clicking on it navigates you to the `Startup Robot` workflow where you can efficiently configure the network connection and establish a seamless link between the app and the robot.

## System Info Tab

The `System Info` tab contains details about the robot's system. Here are the items available:

1. **Robot Firmware Version:** Displays the current version of the robot's firmware.
2. **App Version:** Shows the version of the RoCS Control App, keeping users informed about the application's updates.
3. **App Language:** Allows users to select their preferred language from options such as Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and English.
4. **Log Recording:** A convenient toggle button that enables or disables log recording. This feature is valuable for capturing detailed records of system activity.

These settings empower users to stay informed about the system's status, make language preferences, and control log recording for effective troubleshooting and system monitoring.

Feel free to explore these settings, customize them to your preferences, and leverage the information provided to enhance your interaction with the robot through the RoCS Control App.
