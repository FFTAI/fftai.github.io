# Overview

The motion library of the RoCS serves as a repository of predefined motor skills and motions that a robot can perform, offering several key features:

1. **Database of Reusable Motor Behaviors:** It acts as a comprehensive database housing a collection of motor behaviors and functions that can be readily utilized.
2. **Control Software Functions:** The library includes software functions that enable the activation and control of these predefined motions.
3. **Diverse Motion Types:** These motions encompass a wide range of actions, such as gestures, poses, gaits, grasping maneuvers, and calibrations.
4. **Categorized Organization:** Typically, the library is organized into categories, grouping motions based on their application, such as arm motions, navigation, head movements, and more.
5. **Customization Flexibility:** Engineers can mix and match these predefined motions as needed for specific robotic applications, thanks to parameterization, which allows for customization.
6. **Continuous Expansion:** The library is dynamic, allowing for the continuous addition of new motions and motor skills as technology and requirements evolve.
7. **Streamlined Robot Control:** Leveraging the motion library simplifies robot control by providing a library of established behaviors that can be easily accessed.
8. **Motion Planning and Optimization:** Onboard motion planning algorithms can optimize and blend motions to ensure smooth and efficient execution.
9. **High-Level Control:** By referencing desired motions from the library, high-level control of the robot becomes more straightforward and efficient.

The motion library serves as a valuable resource that offers a collection of reusable motor functions as building blocks for a wide range of robotic tasks. This approach eliminates the need for repetitive, low-level reprogramming of each behavior and streamlines the development of robotic applications.

!> As of the current implementation, the Motion Library provides a set of predefined motions. Please be aware that the available motions are limited in scope. However, we are actively working on expanding the library to incorporate a broader range of motions and functionalities in future updates. Stay tuned for enhanced motion capabilities and increased flexibility in upcoming releases. Your understanding and patience are greatly appreciated as we continue to improve and enrich the Motion Library.
