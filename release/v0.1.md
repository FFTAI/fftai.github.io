# GROS v0.1 Release Notes

**Date:** August 18, 2023

The Robot Remote Control System (GROS) version 0.1 has been released, providing comprehensive remote control capabilities for robots. GROS is divided into three main components: the Control App (user graphical application), the Frontend (client interface), and the Backend (server interface). Here's a brief overview of the release:

## System Architecture

The GROS system is structured to ensure code modularity and development standards. Future development will adhere to these conventions.

## Frontend-Backend Communication

In this release, we have established seamless data transmission between the Frontend and Backend, enabling the retrieval of values required for the "Developer Page." Subsequent feature additions will only require the creation of new data APIs.

## Frontend Support

The Frontend currently supports JavaScript, making it easy to integrate into web applications and mobile apps. We plan to provide a Python version in the future to cater to various development needs. The code is already available on GitHub and is prepared for open-source contributions when needed.
**GitHub Repository:** [FFTAI/client_js](https://github.com/FFTAI/client_js)

## Backend Security

The Backend code is designed with a focus on security and stability. It is stored within the local network and is not exposed externally.

## Documentation and Website

We have defined the documentation creation process and the method for website publication. Each update can be published with a single click. Although the documentation is currently limited, we will continue to expand its content in the future.

**Backend API Documentation:** [Server API](docs/server_api/readme.md)

**Frontend API Documentation:** [Client SDK](docs/sdk_js/readme.md)

## Control App

* The "Developer Page" is now completed, although the 3D model is still in progress.

* Logs and sensor data are synchronized in real-time from the physical robot.

* The 3D rendering web component has undergone initial technical validation, and a professional team has been outsourced to create the 3D model, which will enhance the user experience when integrated into the Developer Page.

* Currently, Android development is underway and progressing well. Due to urgent support requirements in the motor components, there have been some delays, but we are working diligently to complete it as soon as possible.
