## New Feature:

**Smooth Movement Example for Single Motor Control**

In RoCS V1.2, we introduce a remarkable new feature that demonstrates smooth and precise control of a single motor. This example showcases how users can achieve fluid and graceful movements of a specific motor, enabling the robot to perform tasks with increased finesse. Whether it's rotating an arm, tilting a head, or any other motor-controlled action, this feature empowers users with greater control and flexibility.
