# rocs_model Introduction


rocs_model is a key component in RoCS that is responsible for external synchronization of robot 3D model information. It highly restores the coordinates and position of the robot and presents a beautiful UI through the http service

The interior of rocs_model monitors the real-time position coordinate information of the robot through remote monitoring, and renders the model through websocket, a high-performance real-time communication method. This interaction provides developers with an intuitive understanding of the robot's current state, improving control and monitoring efficiency.

rocs_model played a pivotal role in the development process. It enables developers to implement the visual representation of the robot, including its external features and structural aspects. This ability has proven to be useful for monitoring and understanding the robot's status, movement, and performing tasks.

For developers in robotic systems, the RoCS model is a powerful tool, providing the ability to better understand and visualize the details of the robot's appearance and structure throughout the development process.
