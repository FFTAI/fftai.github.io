# rocs_model Introduction


RoCS model, within the RoCS framework, serves as a crucial component responsible for delivering 3D model information of the robot. Specifically, it enables the upper-level system to retrieve visual details such as the appearance and structure of the robot through an HTTP interface.

In the development process, RoCS model plays a pivotal role. It empowers developers to achieve visual representation of the robot, encompassing its external features and structural aspects. This capability proves invaluable for monitoring and comprehending the robot's status, movements, and executed tasks.

The workflow of RoCS model typically involves the user interface or other applications sending an HTTP request to obtain 3D model information of the robot. Upon receiving the request, RoCS model responds with the relevant information, allowing the upper-level system to dynamically access real-time visual details of the robot's appearance and structure. This interaction provides developers with an intuitive understanding of the robot's current state, enhancing control and monitoring efficiency.

RoCS model serves as a potent tool for developers within a robot system, offering the capability to better comprehend and visualize the external appearance and structural details of the robot throughout the development process.
