# Overview of the Control Features

The RoCS Control App offers a comprehensive array of features designed for seamless control and interaction with the robotic system.

**Operation Modes:**
The application includes two primary operation modes: **Remote Control Mode** and **Developer Mode**.

In Remote Control Mode, users can select various motion options and control the robot's movements, maneuvering it forward, backward, left, right, and adjusting the visual focus. This can be achieved using either a joystick or touchscreen controls on a mobile device.

Switching to Developer Mode provides insights into the robot's current motion state, including the angles of individual joints and the robot's current velocity. This mode is particularly useful for users with a technical understanding of the robot's mechanics.

**Basic Movements:**
The fundamental movements are categorized into four modes:

* **Gait Motion Mode:** In this mode, users can control the robot's forward, backward, left, and right movements, offering a dynamic and directional approach.
* **Stationary Motion Mode:** Offering control over the robot's movements while stationed, this mode facilitates dynamic action demonstrations in a fixed position.
* **Standing Mode:** The robot maintains a static standing posture in this mode, suitable for scenarios requiring a stationary robot presence.
* **End Effector Motion Mode:** Introducing a specialized mode, users can engage the robot in end effector grasping actions, providing a unique capability for tasks involving object manipulation.

Each mode serves distinct purposes, providing flexibility for various applications. The Gait Motion Mode facilitates directional movements, the Stationary Motion Mode allows for on-the-spot actions, and the Standing Mode maintains a static standing position. the End Effector MotionMode **e**xpands the robot's capabilities by allowing users to control additional end effector movements.

These features enhance the user experience by offering a versatile range of control options, catering to both standard and advanced users' preferences.
