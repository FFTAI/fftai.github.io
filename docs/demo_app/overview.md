# Introduction

## Overview of RoCS Control App

The RoCS Control App is designed for developers seeking precise control over robotic systems. Its primary function is to facilitate seamless communication between users and robots, offering a user-friendly interface for controlling various aspects of robot behavior.

**Key Functions:**

* **Remote Control**: Developers can effortlessly command the robot to execute a variety of actions, including walking, running, waving hands etc.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** The app provides an intuitive graphical interface, streamlining interactions between developers and robotic systems. 
* **Data View:** Real-time display of diverse sensor data is a core feature. This includes crucial information such as joint states and postions. The Data View feature enhances the developer's ability to monitor and fine-tune the robot's behavior in real-time.

Unlike consumer-oriented products, this app is not designed for end-users; instead, it functions as an extensive reference. It provides detailed insights into the app's functionalities and the underlying logic that governs its operations.

# Purpose of the Developer Guide

 This guide introduces the app's functionalities and serves as an invaluable resource for developers looking to comprehend the app's inner workings and refine it with precision for potential market deployment.

It will begin by explaining how to operate the robot using the Remote Controller, on which the Control APP is running. Following that, it will walk you through the process of creating your own APP using the Control APP's source code as a foundation.

# Target Audience

This guide is tailored for developers and system integrators who aim to work with the RoCS Control App and the Fourier robot products.

To make the most of this document, a solid understanding of Vue.js, including components, Vue Router, and Vuex, is crucial. Familiarity with modern JavaScript features, along with a grasp of state management patterns, will greatly enhance your comprehension. Basic knowledge of asynchronous programming is also recommended.
