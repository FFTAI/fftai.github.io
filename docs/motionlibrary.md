## Motion Library

The motion library of the RoCS serves as a repository of predefined motor skills and motions that a robot can perform, offering several key features:

1. **Database of Reusable Motor Behaviors:** It acts as a comprehensive database housing a collection of motor behaviors and functions that can be readily utilized.
2. **Control Software Functions:** The library includes software functions that enable the activation and control of these predefined motions.
3. **Diverse Motion Types:** These motions encompass a wide range of actions, such as gestures, poses, gaits, grasping maneuvers, and calibrations.
4. **Categorized Organization:** Typically, the library is organized into categories, grouping motions based on their application, such as arm motions, navigation, head movements, and more.
5. **Customization Flexibility:** Engineers can mix and match these predefined motions as needed for specific robotic applications, thanks to parameterization, which allows for customization.
6. **Continuous Expansion:** The library is dynamic, allowing for the continuous addition of new motions and motor skills as technology and requirements evolve.
7. **Streamlined Robot Control:** Leveraging the motion library simplifies robot control by providing a library of established behaviors that can be easily accessed.
8. **Motion Planning and Optimization:** Onboard motion planning algorithms can optimize and blend motions to ensure smooth and efficient execution.
9. **High-Level Control:** By referencing desired motions from the library, high-level control of the robot becomes more straightforward and efficient.

The motion library serves as a valuable resource that offers a collection of reusable motor functions as building blocks for a wide range of robotic tasks. This approach eliminates the need for repetitive, low-level reprogramming of each behavior and streamlines the development of robotic applications.
