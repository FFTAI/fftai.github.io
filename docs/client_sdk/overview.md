# Overview


The SDK plays a vital role in applications seeking to command the GR-1, acquire sensor data, establish payload services, etc.

Operating on the principle of encapsulation, the SDK neatly packages fundamental robot functions into distinct classes, each armed with specialized methods. Developers can harness these encapsulated capabilities through provided interfaces, facilitating the seamless creation of customized applications. Whether fine-tuning low-level motor operations, orchestrating high-level motion sequences, handling audio/video transmission, implementing SLAM for mapping, or monitoring odometry, the SDK's modular structure ensures flexibility and simplicity in customization for developers.

This quickstart guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to help you install the necessary SDK libraries (both in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript) and run basic programs for GR-1 control.
