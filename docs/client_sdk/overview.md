# Overview

The SDK operates based on the concept of encapsulation, neatly organizing essential robot functions into separate classes, each equipped with specialized methods. Developers can make use of these encapsulated capabilities through provided interfaces, making it easy to create customized applications seamlessly. Whether you need to fine-tune low-level motor operations, coordinate complex high-level motion sequences, manage audio/video transmission, implement SLAM for mapping, or monitor odometry, the SDK's modular structure ensures flexibility and simplicity for developers to customize your solutions.

This reference guide is designed to assist you in navigating the various modules and classes, demonstrating how they can be effectively employed in application development. It serves as a fundamental resource for developers.
