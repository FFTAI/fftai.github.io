# RoCS Server Installation Guide

## **System Requirements**

* A PC  with at least a 2 GHz dual core CPU clock speed and 2 GB of RAM is a minimum requirement.
* Operating system: Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases, including versions 22.04 and 20.04.
* An NVIDIA or AMD OpenGL (minimum version 3.3) capable graphics adapter with at least 512 MB of RAM is required.

## Installation

The RoCS server can be installed fully automatically via bash script. You can download the bach script either using `curl` or `wget`.

### Script for RoCS Server Installation using `curl`

```
curl -o- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FFTAI/rocs_server/v1.3.0/install.sh> | bash
```

This script utilizes `curl` to download and execute the installation script for the "rocs_server" from a specific GitHub repository and version (v1.3.0).

* **curl**: Command-line tool for making HTTP requests. It's used here to download content from a URL.
* **-o-**: Option instructs curl to write the downloaded content to standard output (usually the console).
* [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FFTAI/rocs_server/v1.3.0/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FFTAI/rocs_server/v1.3.0/install.sh): URL of the installation script on GitHub. curl fetches the content from this URL.
* **|**: Pipe operator. It takes the output (script content fetched by curl) and passes it as input to the next command.
* **bash**: Command that executes the content received from curl as a Bash script. It essentially runs the installation script.

### Script for RoCS Server Installation using `wget`

```
wget -qO- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FFTAI/rocs_server/v1.3.0/install.sh> | bash
```

This command uses `wget` to download and execute the installation script for the "rocs_server" from a specific GitHub repository and version (v1.3.0).

* **wget:** A command-line utility for non-interactive downloading of files from the web.
* **-qO-:** Options for `wget`.

  * `-q:` Quiet mode, which suppresses output.
  * `-O-:` Specifies where to write the downloaded content; `-` indicates standard output.
* **[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FFTAI/rocs_server/v1.3.0/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FFTAI/rocs_server/v1.3.0/install.sh):** URL of the installation script on GitHub. `wget` fetches the content from this URL.
* **|:** Pipe operator. It takes the output (script content fetched by `wget`) and passes it as input to the next command.
* **bash:** Command that executes the content received from `wget` as a Bash script. It essentially runs the installation script.

!> The installation directory `.rocs_server1.3.0` is hidden. If you are in a terminal, you can use the `ls -a` command to display it. If you are in the file manager, you can use the **Ctrl+H**  keyboard shortcut to display it. or use the file manager GUI to display the hidden folders by go to the **top-right hamburger menu â†’ Show hidden files**.

### Introduction to the Installation Script `install.sh`

!> This section is provided for your reference. The entire installation process has already been completed by the bash script downloaded via curl or wget in the preceding steps.

```

# !/bin/bash

set -e

git clone -b v1.3.0 [https://github.com/FFTAI/rocs_server.git](https://github.com/FFTAI/rocs_server.git) ~/.rocs_server1.3.0

cd ~/.rocs_server1.3.0/lib
sh install.sh

cd ~/.rocs_server1.3.0
rm -rf ./bin*
wget [https://github.com/FFTAI/rocs_server/releases/download/v1.3.0/bin.zip](https://github.com/FFTAI/rocs_server/releases/download/v1.3.0/bin.zip)
unzip bin.zip

cd ~/.rocs_server1.3.0
rm -rf ./sbin*
wget [https://github.com/FFTAI/rocs_server/releases/download/v1.3.0/sbin.zip](https://github.com/FFTAI/rocs_server/releases/download/v1.3.0/sbin.zip)
unzip sbin.zip

```

This Bash script performs the following actions:

1. **Clone repository:** It clones the `rocs_server` repository from GitHub, specifically the `v1.3.0` branch, into the `~/.rocs_server1.3.0` directory in your home folder.
2. **Install dependencies:** It navigates to the `.rocs_server1.3.0/lib` directory and executes the `install.sh` script. This script handles the installation of dependencies and other necessary setup tasks.
3. **Download and extract bin.zip:** It returns to the `.rocs_server1.3.0` directory, removes all files and directories starting with `bin`, and then uses `wget` to download a compressed file named `bin.zip`. Finally, it extracts the contents of `bin.zip`.
4. **Download and extract sbin.zip:** Similarly, it returns to the `.rocs_server1.3.0` directory, removes all files and directories starting with `sbin`, and uses `wget` to download a compressed file named `sbin.zip`. It then extracts the contents of `sbin.zip`.

The `set -e` at the beginning ensures that the script exits immediately if any command returns a non-zero exit status, indicating an error during execution. This helps to detect and respond to errors promptly during script execution.

### Introduction to the `lib` folder

!> This section is provided for your reference. The entire installation process has already been completed by the bash script downloaded via curl or wget in the preceding steps.

The lib folder includes three libraries which are installed via the auto bash script `install.sh` under the lib folder.

This script sets up the system for software development by installing necessary tools and libraries and then builds and installs specific libraries required for linear algebra, quadratic programming, and rigid body dynamics computations:

1. **Update Package Lists**: `sudo apt update -y` updates the list of available software packages.
2. **Upgrade Installed Packages**: `sudo apt upgrade -y` upgrades the installed software packages to their latest versions.
3. **Fix Broken Packages**: `sudo apt --fix-broken install -y` attempts to fix any broken dependencies among installed packages.
4. **Install Essential Tools and Libraries**: Various commands (`sudo apt install ... -y`) install essential tools and libraries needed for software development, including CMake, Eigen3 (a linear algebra library), build-essential, cmake-curses-gui, libunittest++-dev, and qtbase5-dev.
5. **Build and Install Eigen**: The script then builds and installs the Eigen library, a C++ template library for linear algebra.
6. **Build and Install qpOASES**: Next, it builds and installs qpOASES, a software library designed for solving quadratic programming (QP) problems.
7. **Build and Install RBDL (Rigid Body Dynamics Library)**: The script builds and installs RBDL, a library for rigid body dynamics computations.
8. **Cleanup**: The script removes temporary build directories for Eigen, qpOASES, and RBDL to free up space.
9. **Library Configuration**: `sudo ldconfig` updates the shared library cache to include the newly installed libraries, making them accessible to other programs.
