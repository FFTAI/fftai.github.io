# Quick start

This documentation is intended to guide you for the extended development of GR-1 based on the SDKs provided.

Two approaches are provided to control and develop the GR-1 robot:

* Through virtual environment Webots
* Through physical robot

For the development using virtual environment, refer to [Extended Development Through Virtual Environment Webots](#extended-development-through-virtual-environment-webots).

For the development using physical robot, refer to [Extended Development Through Physical GR-1 Robot](#extended-development-through-physical-gr-1-robot).

In this document, we will step by step describe how to run the App and SDK, demonstrating both the real machine and the virtual environment.

First, install the virtual environment. For RoCS, using Ubuntu + Webots is the most convenient. So here we demonstrate how to use the Remote Control App and SDK to connect to the GR-1 in the virtual environment first, and then controlling the physical robot.
