# GROS v0.2 Release Notes

**Date:** September 15, 2023

In GROS version 0.2, we have made significant advancements in the Backend API, Frontend SDK, and Control App, ensuring synchronization of Tier1-defined features between the Backend and Frontend. Extensive real-world testing has been carried out, but due to the unavailability of physical robots, a demonstration version has been created for use in a simulated environment.

### Features Completed

- **Connection and Login**: Implemented seamless connectivity and login functionality.
- **Control Interface**: Designed a user-friendly control interface.
- **Developer Interface**: Enhanced the developer interface.
- **Settings Interface**: Developed a settings interface.

### Documentation

We have unified the style of all our documentation and centralized it on [fftai.github.io](https://fftai.github.io). However, please note that the documentation style remains unchanged in this version; it currently follows the default GitHub style. Style adjustments and beautification are planned for the next version.

Current documentation content is also limited, and we will continue to expand it in subsequent versions.
