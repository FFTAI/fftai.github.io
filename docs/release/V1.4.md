# RoCS V1.4 Release Notes

Date: January 2024

We are thrilled to introduce RoCS (Robot Control System) version 1.4, a significant update with a primary focus on optimizing the standing pose for robots. In this release, we have introduced new capabilities to ensure the robot maintains a safe and stable posture, especially during the standing phase. Here's a comprehensive overview of the improvements in this version:

## Standing Pose Optimization

In RoCS V1.4, our top priority has been to enhance the robot's standing pose, aligning it precisely with the calibration pose. This optimization is crucial to ensure both precision and safety in robot positioning during various tasks.

### Key Improvements:

* **Automatic Posture Check:** RoCS now automatically verifies the robot's position against the calibrated pose.
* **Offset Tolerance:** If the robot's posture deviates beyond an acceptable offset range from the calibrated pose, the system will detect it.
* **Stand Button Availability:** To maintain safety and prevent motor overloading, the "Stand" button will be made unavailable if the robot's posture falls outside the acceptable range.

### Benefits:

* **Enhanced Precision:** By ensuring the robot's standing pose closely aligns with the calibration pose, we enhance precision in various applications.
* **Motor Overload Avoidance:** Preventing the robot from standing in a tilting pose helps avoid motor overloading, ensuring the longevity and reliability of the robot.
* **Safety Assurance:** Unavailability of the "Stand" button when the posture is out of range promotes safety and prevents unintended actions.

### Motor Overloading Prevention:

* One of the critical aspects of this optimization is preventing motor overloading, which can occur when the robot attempts to stand in an unstable or tilted position.
* By restricting the "Stand" button's availability when the robot's posture is outside the acceptable range, we actively mitigate the risk of motor overloading.
* This proactive approach ensures the robot operates safely and efficiently during standing and movement.

We believe that the standing pose optimization in RoCS V1.4, with its focus on motor overload prevention, will significantly improve the overall performance and safety of robot control. It reinforces our commitment to providing cutting-edge solutions for human-robot interaction and control.

Thank you for your continued support and trust in RoCS as we strive to enhance both precision and safety in robot control.
