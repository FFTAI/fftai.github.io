# Python Library

The Python library is used by applications to control GR-1, read sensor information, and register payload services.

#### Using the Python Library

The [Python Quick start](quickstart.md) is the recommended way to get started using the Python library. It is a step-by-step guide that will help you install the Python libraries you need and run simple programs to control GR-1.

[Understanding GR-1 Programming](understanding_spot_programming.md) goes deeper than the Quick Start and covers some of the key concepts of developing applications for GR-1.

The [Python example programs](../../python/examples/README.md) demonstrate how to use the Python library, and can be used as reference programs for your own applications.

The [Python reference guide](../../python/README.md) documents all of the Python modules, classes, and interfaces in detail.

#### Supported Platforms and Versions

The Python client library is supported on the following platforms:

* Ubuntu 20 or above
* Python 3.11 or above
