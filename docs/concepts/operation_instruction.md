# Operation Instruction

This section is to guide you through the process of setting up and operating the Fourier Robot. Since the robot is delivered fully assembled, we will focus on the initial setup and basic operation.

## Initial Setup and Powering on

### Unpacking the Robot

!> Due to the substantial weight and intricate design of the robot, it is crucial to engage at least two individuals in the unboxing process. This collaborative effort ensures safe and secure handling, minimizing the risk of potential damage caused by pinching or accidental dropping.

To begin, carefully follow these steps:

1. Begin by extracting the robot from its packaging box.
2. Verify the items against the provided packing list.
