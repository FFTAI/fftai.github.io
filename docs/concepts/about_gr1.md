This robotic marvel exhibits remarkable human-like agility and motion kinematics, including the ability to perform tasks such as:

* Straight leg walking
* High-speed walking
* Agile obstacle avoidance
* Graceful slope ascension and descension
* Robust response to impacts
* Seamless human-robot collaboration in task execution.

These capabilities position the Fourier GR-1 as a promising platform for the future of "Embodied AI", which is widely believed to be the next wave of artificial intelligence. As a carrier for artificial intelligence to interact with the physical world, embodied intelligence combines artificial intelligence technology with robot entities, so that the "brain" has a disposable, perceivable, interactive, and actionable "body", which brings great convenience and benefits as an important partner and assistant of human beings.

The Fourier GR-1's scalability lends itself to the validation of various AI models and algorithms, opening up exciting possibilities for applications in industries, rehabilitation, household, and research.
