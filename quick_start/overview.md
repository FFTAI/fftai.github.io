# Overview

As previously mentioned in the [About RoCS](concepts/about_rocs.md) section, the RoCS comprises three main components: the Server, the SDK, and the Control APP. To establish the RoCS environment to control robot, you'll need to start by installing the server. Following that, you can proceed to install either the SDK or the Control APP, depending on your requirements for interacting with the server and controlling the robot.

This quick start guide will walk you through the process of configuring the RoCS programming environment using the Python client SDK and JavaScript/TypeScript client SDK, both for simulated robot and for physical robot.

* To configure RoCS for **simulated robot**, see [Configuring RoCS for Simulated Robot](quick_start/setup_for_simulated_robot.md).
* To configure RoCS for **physical robot**, see [Configuring RoCS for Physical Robot](quick_start/setup_for_physical_robot.md).

If you're interested in controlling the robot via the Control APP, please refer to the [Remote Control APP Developer Guide](demo_app/overview.md) for more instructions.
