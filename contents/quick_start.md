# Quick Start
In this document, we will step by step describe how to run the App and SDK, demonstrating both the real machine and the virtual environment.

First, install the virtual environment. For RoCS, using Ubuntu + Webots is the most convenient. So here we demonstrate how to use the Remote Control App and SDK to connect to the GR-1 in the virtual environment first, and then controlling the physical robot.
